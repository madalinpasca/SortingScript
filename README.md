Write a console application that reads a file containing a list of numbers:
11, 22, 1, 34, 2, 3, 10, 333
Support command-line arguments so that the user will be able to specify the following options:
● File to read from
● Sort order (ascending / descending)
● Sort type:
○ Number sort: 1 < 2 < 11 < 22
○ String sort: 1 < 11 < 2 < 22
○ Hybrid sort: 22 < 2 < 1 < 11 - even descending and then odd ascending
The program should output the sorted result to the console window.
